This framework in this repository is aimed at standards adoption practitioners aiming to present the components of a JSONSchema standard or specification to non-familiar audiences. An existing JSONSchema file is a prerequisite.

Within this how-to guide, the focus is on the [Social Economy Data Lab](http://socialeconomydatalab.org/), its [Specification](http://spec.socialeconomydatalab.org/en/latest/), the [Schema](https://github.com/SocialEconomyDataLab/spec/blob/master/schema/schema.json).
