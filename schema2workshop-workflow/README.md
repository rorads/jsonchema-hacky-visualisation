# Developing Visual Representations of JSONSchema Specifications

This framework in this repository is aimed at standards adoption practitioners aiming to present the components of a JSONSchema standard or specification to non-familiar audiences. An existing JSONSchema file is a prerequisite.

Within this how-to guide, the focus is on the [Social Economy Data Lab](http://socialeconomydatalab.org/), its [Specification](http://spec.socialeconomydatalab.org/en/latest/), the [Schema](https://github.com/SocialEconomyDataLab/spec/blob/master/schema/schema.json).

Before beginning, ensure the following:

1. You have a full, valid JSONSchema which describes your data standard. It doesn't have to be final, but it must be functional (in that all of the references resolve, etc.). See [this schema](https://github.com/SocialEconomyDataLab/spec/blob/master/schema/schema.json) for an example.
2. You have access too this online tool: https://json-editor.github.io/json-editor. It is the backbone of this process, so play around with your schema and get familiar with the user interface.
3. OPTIONAL: get to grips with Chrome's 'Overrides' feature - it's really useful for persisting the tweaks you make to CSS.
